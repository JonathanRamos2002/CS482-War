Our goal is to build and deliver a real-time multiplayer card game to engage users and improve long-term user retention. To build our web app, we will use modern web development technologies. This will ensure we provide a responsive, and smooth user experience. The application's front end will be developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, we will use React, the JavaScript library. React allows us to create highly reusable code through components. All the components we build return HTML which can be dynamically injected into our main HTML file. 

    Our program logic is handled appropriately depending on the purpose the code serves. Each component handles its necessary back-end logic within its file and at the end returns the necessary HTML for the front-end. If the code is not react component then it drives the foundation of the application in which the back-end logic is handled within the appropriate file, however, these files do not return any HTML for the front-end. 

    Our project also takes advantage of the features of a modern database. We chose to use Firebase as our database for this application due to its built in authentication support. Firebase provides us the responsive database we need for a real-time multiplayer game as we need to ensure all players at a table receive the same information.
