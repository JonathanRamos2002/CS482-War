\section{Persistent Storage}
Our database is composed of three main firebase components, Authentication, Firestore, and Storage. Each of these components is responsible for storing different types of information for each user. The authentication component is responsible for storing user login information, in our application this is the email and password of every user. Importantly, the Authentication component hashes passwords with a built-in function which improves security for our users. The storage component is responsible for storing the profile images of every user. The profile picture uploaded by the user is saved to the storage component under `avatars/user.uid' in which the current user's id is used as the filename. The majority of our user's data will be saved in the Firestore component. The data will be organized as JSON documents which are then organized into collections. The user's information such as, username, friends, stats, and profile picture URL will be saved into a document appropriately titled as the `user.uid'. Each user will require their own document, and all user documents will be stored in the `users' collection. This structure is flexible, making it scale-able which is important for an online multiplayer game. Our NoSQL design ensures that we can continue adding more collections and documents as needed without restructuring the entire database.
